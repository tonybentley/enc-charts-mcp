# Direct Handler Canvas Visualization

## Overview
This test approach demonstrates coastline extraction using direct handler calls and simple canvas rendering, without any MCP protocol overhead or external map dependencies.

## What Makes This Different

### Previous Test Approaches:
1. **MCP Protocol Tests** - Required complex JSON-RPC communication with timeouts
2. **Leaflet-based Visualizations** - Used OpenStreetMap tiles as base layers
3. **E2E Tests** - Full server initialization with protocol negotiation

### This Approach:
- **Direct Handler Invocation** - Bypasses MCP server, calls handlers directly
- **Pure Canvas Rendering** - No map tiles, just raw vector data on colored background
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only requires Node.js and browser for visualization
- **Fast Iteration** - No server startup or protocol overhead

## Test Results

### Shelter Island Validation
- **Location**: San Diego Bay (32.714935, -117.228975)
- **Chart**: US5CA72M
- **Features Extracted**: 17 coastline features
- **Total Length**: 25.49 km
- **Result**: âœ… Shelter Island correctly appears as a peninsula (connected to mainland)

### Feature Sources Identified
- **COALNE** (Blue) - Natural coastline features
- **BUAARE** (Yellow) - Built-up area boundaries
- **ACHARE** (Purple) - Anchorage area boundaries

## Files in This Directory

1. **`test-script.js`** - The test script that extracts and visualizes coastlines
2. **`coastline-data.json`** - Raw GeoJSON data from the extraction
3. **`render.html`** - Canvas-based visualization (no external dependencies)
4. **`screenshot.png`** - Visual proof of the rendered coastlines

## How to Reproduce

```bash
# From project root
node docs/renders/direct-handler-canvas-visualization/test-script.js

# Open the visualization
open docs/renders/direct-handler-canvas-visualization/render.html

# Take screenshot (manually or with Playwright)
```

## Key Advantages

1. **Speed** - No server startup, direct handler execution
2. **Clarity** - Pure vector rendering shows exactly what was extracted
3. **Debugging** - Easy to inspect raw data and visual output
4. **Portability** - HTML file works offline, no external dependencies
5. **Validation** - Peninsula vs island distinction is immediately visible
